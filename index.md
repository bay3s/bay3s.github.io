These are my musings on machine learning and algorithmic trading. While machine learning is my core discipline, Iâ€™ve been exploring its applications in financial markets, particularly in developing algorithmic trading strategies aimed at generating absolute returns. I'm fascinated by the intersection of these fields and am keen to experiment on the fringes.

Having worked as a programmer and written substantial code, I see machine learning as a transformative advancement in how we interact with, instruct, and leverage compute. The technology has enabled algorithms capable of complex behaviors and solving challenges in high-dimensional input spaces. This significant evolution in our ability to address real-world problems motivates my interest in the topic.

In addition to machine learning, I've found algorithmic trading to be one of the most intellectually stimulating pursuits as it demands a unique blend of mathematics, programming, and creativity. Moreover, competing with some of the brightest minds in the world in free markets forces you to stay sharp and on your toes, which I quite appreciate.

My experimental projects are driven by personal interest and trial-and-error exploration, which I hope to share here. My writing reflects my ongoing tryst with theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning as well as algorithmic trading.
